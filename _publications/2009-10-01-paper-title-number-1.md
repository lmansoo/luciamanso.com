Key points of the paper: 

- Due to the slow growth of Low-grade gliomas (LGGs), cognitive impairments can be quite difficult to detect at early stages

- There is a lack of staff specialized on the cognitive and emotional assessment of patients, such as neuropsychologists and speech therapists

- Brain tumor patients are often misclassified as asymptomatic at the moment of diagnosis

- An accurate and individually-designed assessment of their cognitive status can significantly improve the treatment strategy for each patient, allowing long-term planning and substantial differences in post-operative outcomes

- Healthcare facilities treating LGG patients should give high priority to the formal inclusion of trained professionals capable of designing and implementing adequate pre- and post-operative strategies. By addressing this challenge, it is possible to guide clinical interventions and close the gap between surgery and rehabilitation therapy
